Week 4 - UI 
Q & A

-Using qt.py
-Re-watching the videos multiple times
-Reading through
-Everything is a widget

• Why is PySide the most important UI library?
-It is free and is available in all DCCs
> Why use Qt.py?
- Downside is that it is not implemented in the software and you need to download and install it. Also, it cannot have the functions of all elements (pySide, pySide2, PyQt, PyQt5, etc), it is a middle ground. There are a small amount of things that you don't have and need to write yourself. 
• What are the benefits and drawbacks of QtDesigner UI?
Positive: 
-Realtime feedback and intuitive when building the UI
-You have the .ui file that helps you identify the names of every object/widget
Downside: 
1. You can't do procedural UIs with this. 
2. Not all functionality is not there in the QtDesigner that you need to do via code
3. There are small differences in the UIs between softwares.
• How does UI design benefit your application?
-Artists will want to use it. 
-Intuitive, Familiar, Communication
-Familiar to something you know (Photoshop, Phone-design, Z-pattern)

**Try to avoid abstract phrases when describing things.

Q: Reloading a class>
Alex - Why would you want to reload a class?
If it's in another module just import the module of the class.
Garvey - I'm making edits to the class and the changes are only updated if I kill the DCC and relaunch it. 
Does importing the Class 'reload'/import updates made to it?

Q: Is it possible to add an icon to a line edit? Or maybe just place a button next to it Or Icon instead of a button?

Q: What is the best thing to use for a resizable section of a the layout?

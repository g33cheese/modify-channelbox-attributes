WK3 - Advanced Python 
Q & A Notes:



This is the longest and hardest module.



When do we need configuration and data files?
Configuration file:
1. Separate files from the code base. User doesn't need to access code base. Step before creating the UI, the bridge before the UI. 
2. The script is the same but the results are different for different teams based on their configuration files. It's not hard-coded into the base code. 
3. The configuration file allows more flexibility without needing to rewrite the base code. Making one script more flexible and extended its use. 
4. The configuration file acts as an entry way for different user/dept/studios. 
There is a consideration that someone is 


Data file:
-Normally you don't modify the information in a data file. 
-You don't care about the format. No one will be opening it. It's usually a data dump. 

When should we use classes?
-A node is a perfect example of a class. Everything uses a node. 
-Nodes and node overrides
-Class's self allows you to not need global and local variables. Everything is accessible inside itself (container)

What is the purpose of generators?
-Must know but don't need to use them. 
-Generators don't store the data in memory (RAM).
-Generators are faster. 
-Generators are closer to computer language. 
-If you need to calculate something a generator is a good way to go. Speed. 
-Better performance and need for space. 


Decorator
-A guranteed before and after
-You can do it manually but a decorator gurantees that it happens. 
-It is more of a structural thing. Adds a touch of complexity. 

Recommended to watch, TD Meetup 03. 
-Alex used everything in Advanced Python in there, except generators.

Python Co-pilot
-Slowly start to integrate it into your workflow
-Don't fully trust its answers but give it a try. 
-Video of the TD Meetup on this topic is coming out at the end of the week. 
-It could be a 25% productivity boost. 


Mark goes to chatGPT when he's looking something up that he used to search on Google for. 
-Stuff for Maya is good but he finds that stuff for Unreal ChatGPT just makes the stuff up.

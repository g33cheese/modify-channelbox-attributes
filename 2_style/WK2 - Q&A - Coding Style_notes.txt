WK2 - Coding Style

Discord
Don't worry about time zone to ask your question. 
Never ask a lazy question.



The biggest benefit to coding style is that:
1. it looks professional. 
2. You give someone you work with professional code. 

*You will immediately upgrade your code to junior/amateur to professional.

WK 5 Q&A: We will each have 10-15 mins to present our tool. It is good practice for us to do at a company. 


1. What is PEP8?
A: A style guide. If you learn PEP8 you will be fine at 90% of companies. 
Follow it to an 80-90%. 

2. How does coding style improve your (team) work?
A: The guidelines are the best guidelines. 

* Alexander always wants the clearest answer. 

3. What is your most important coding style rule?
A: Alex: My favourite is one statement per line. 
* If Alex sees an asterisk in a import he will flag that for a code review. He absolutely hates it. 
Fabio - dividers
Garvey - comments and chunking
Mark - asterisks on import



Alex: Don't underestimate the first impression of your code. 

Alex: Here's an example. A lot of the code at Weta was old. If code is like that you cannot start a new way. Even though I wanted to write in PEP8 I couldn't because it would break the code. So I coded in the module's style. 

*It will take 3 months for you to be comfortable with the coding style. 
**Coding style is the first thing that Alex looks at during a code review.

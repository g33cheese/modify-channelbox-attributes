# 40. PREPARE
#*******************************************************************************
    • Install PySide2
    • Download and integrate Qt.py

TIP: Check out pip!
https://pypi.org/project/pip





#*******************************************************************************
# 41. RECREATE arUtil
*******************************************************************************
    • Check out the simpleUI.py module.

    • Rebuild a simple UI by creating simpleUI.ui in Designer and connect it to simpleUI.py.

    NOTE: The code in simpleUI.py is final.
          Build the UI and take a screenshot.





#*******************************************************************************
# 43. REFERENCE app
#*******************************************************************************

Making your first UI using a reference.
A great opportunity to play with all the different widgets and connections.

    a) Choose an image reference of a tool (best to pick a DCC plugin)

    b) Reconstruct the UI in the designer. Make sure to use layouts.

    c) Add (real or pseudo) functionalities to the tool.


NOTE: Combine this with the next task (04) if you don't need the extra practise.





#*******************************************************************************
# 44. CREATE UI
#*******************************************************************************
Create a UI for your application via code or designer.

    a) Commit the "old" application version as "INIT 4_ui"

        • Use PyQt5, PySide2 or Qt.py (whatever works best for you).
        • Use buttons, checkboxes, sliders, edits, colors, layout … the more the better.
        • Make sure that your UI is executable in OS and inside a DCC (e.g. Maya).
        • Follow the UI design rules, make it pretty and make a screenshot.

        • Record a one-minute-video (with or without voice over)
          in which you show the app's functionalities in a real life scenario.
          Make sure it "sells" your app to the audience aka "How does it help the production?"

        • BONUS: Integrate the app into your DCC (shelf, toolbar, menu, ...)

    b) Commit as "DONE 4_ui" and push the updated version to "main/master".
